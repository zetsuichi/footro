        <font color="#F2A365"><b>Hello! Please check the information below,
        before joining our guild.</b></font><br><br>
        We are a guild focused mainly on pve,
        with a slight admixture of wvw.<br>
        FTO uses discord and it is needed,
        if the event <br>we are together at
        requires communication (at least listening).<br>
        All the events we organize are announced
        on discord and / or <a target=_blank href="https://events.footro.cc">our web page</a>.<br><br><br>
        <font color="#F2A365"><b>I'm a new player. Can I join?</b></font><br><br>
        Yes, of course! Our guild supports new players.
        We help with crafting, <br>eq and build selection,
        we answer questions etc.<br><br><br>
        <font color="#F2A365"><b>I'd like to start raiding.</b></font><br><br>
        No problem! The FTO organizes raid trainings.<br>
        Just follow our events and you will surely find something for yourself!<br><br><br>
        <font color="#F2A365"><b>I'm not a very active player. Is this a problem?</b></font><br><br>
        It's not a problem!<br>If you are able to log in at least once every 3 weeks,<br>
        and occasionally participate in events, you will not get a kick.<br>
        Our guild is kicking its members after 3 weeks of inactivity.<br>
        Of course, you can always come back to us.<br><br><br>
        <font color="#F2A365"><b>I don't have / don't want to use Discord.</b></font><br><br>
        You can still join our guild, however you will be excluded from some events,<br>
        organized by the guild, e.g. raids or guild missions.<br>
        If your reason why you can't use voice chat is more complex,<br>
        talk to one of the leaders and you will surely get along somehow.<br><br><br>
        <font color="#F2A365"><b>Are there any rules that should be followed in the guild?</b></font><br><br>
        Yes! We have a set of rules that everyone must accept <br>if they want to join us 
        and observe.
        You will find them <a target=_blank href="https://footro.cc/rules">HERE</a>! 
        <br>Acceptance of the regulations is the basis for a successful recruitment process.<br><br><br>
        <font color="#F2A365"><b>I have read everything and would like to join you!</b></font><br><br>
        Great! Let one of the guild leaders know by /w or in-game e-mail, briefly write something about yourself, 
        <br> and let him know that you accept our regulations! The rest of the recruitment will take place <br>
        through an individual interview.<br><br>
